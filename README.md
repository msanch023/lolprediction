# lolprediction

## By Marco Sanchez

This is a website containing the report for a project done in DSC 80 at UCSD 
where I proposed a prediction problem around the game League of legends 
and trained a baseline and final model to make predictions. I also performed 
a fairness analysis at the end of the project to see if the final model performed 
better or worse for certain groups.
